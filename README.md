# Basic EDI Validator Front End

Minimal front end to call the Stedi EDI Core and display the results, for manual testing

It's just a form, an API call, and a results display, sitting on top of a basic create-react-app, nothing more.

## CORS Errors

Getting cors errors is expected; you can use a browser extension to selectively turn off cors checks.
